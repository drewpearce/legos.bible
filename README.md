# legos.bible

Allows Legobot to provide bible references, using bible-api.com and the World English Bible translation.

## Usage

To reference a passage:

`!bible <book> <chapter>:<verse(s)>`

Book names can be long form, i.e. "Genesis" or "Matthew", or an abbreviation, i.e. "Gen" or "Mat".
Support for various book abbreviations is a part of bible-api. I have yet to find documentation or 
where in the bible-api source code that a full list of supported abbreviations lives.
